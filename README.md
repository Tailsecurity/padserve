# Padserve - Secure Messaging System over Tailscale
This Go-based messaging system implements a secure TCP server-client communication protocol, utilizing Tailscale to establish a secure network overlay. The server and clients use elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange to establish a shared secret for encrypted message exchanges, providing secure, authenticated communication over the Tailscale network.
## Features
 1. **ECDH Key Exchange:** The server and client exchange public keys to establish a shared secret.
 2. **AES and OTP Encryption:** Messages are encrypted using AES for all-clients messages or OTP for one-to-one messages.
 3. **Tailscale Integration:** This system is designed to work exclusively over Tailscale, using its internal IP addresses (100.64.0.0/10).
 4. **Basic Commands:** Support for user registration, listing active users, sending messages, and fetching server information.

## Requirements
 1. [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.23.2 or later)
 2. [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) installed and running
 3. A configured Tailscale network

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

    git clone https://github.com/drewwalton19216801/padserve.git
    cd padserve
## Running the Server
The server automatically detects its Tailscale IP and listens on port `12345`.

 1. Ensure Tailscale is active and configured.
 2. Start the server with: `go run ./cmd/server`
 3. The server will display its Tailscale IP and listen for incoming client connections.

### Server Commands
The server supports the following commands sent from clients:
 -   `REGISTER <ClientID>`: Registers a new client with a unique ID.
 -   `SEND <RecipientID|ALL> <Message>`: Sends a message to a specific client or broadcasts to all.
 -   `LIST`: Lists all connected clients.
 -   `INFO`: Displays server IP and client details.
 -   `SERVERHELP`: Lists available server commands.
## Running the Client

 1. Connect to the Tailscale network and obtain the serverâ€™s Tailscale IP.
 2. Run the client in another terminal with: `go run ./cmd/client <YourID> <TailscaleServerAddress>`, replacing `<YourID>` with your chosen identifier and `<TailscaleServerAddress>` with the server's IP or hostname on the Tailscale network.

### Client Commands
Once connected, the client can use these commands:

 - `SEND <RecipientID|ALL> <Message>`: Send an encrypted message to a specific client or all clients.
 - `LIST`: List all clients connected to the server.
 - `HELP`: Display available client commands.
 - `SERVERHELP`: Display server help text.
 - `EXIT`: Disconnect from the server and exit the client.

### Operator Commands
The first client to connect to the server is given access to Operator commands:

- `KICK <ClientID>`: Kick the specified client from the server.

## Example Usage

 1. Start the server: `go run cmd/server`
 2. Start at least two clients: `go run cmd/client Someone 100.64.x.x`, replacing `Someone` with the client's chosen ID and `100.64.x.x` with the server's Tailscale IP address or hostname.
 3. List connected clients: `LIST`
 4. Send a direct message: `SEND Bob Hello, Bob!`, replacing `Bob` with the client ID of another client.
 5. Send a broadcast message: `SEND ALL Hello, everyone!` 

## Notes

 - Ensure that all clients are on the same Tailscale network.
 - Each client should register with a unique identifier (the server will reject duplicate identifiers).
 - The server supports encrypted messaging; however, it is limited to the Tailscale network.

## Security Considerations

 - Messages are encrypted with either AES (for all-client messages) or OTP encryption (for individual messages).
 - Shared secrets are derived using ECDH and hashed with SHA-256.
